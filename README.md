# live-chat-demo
React + Redux + Websockets = Chat

### What is this?

* A simple starter pack to build upon for a websocket based chat application
* I was bored one weekend and wanted a project to try, still very much a WIP
* There are no tests currently, I know, bad on me. I promise when this gets to a stable 0.1.0 they will be there! Just too much in flux right now
* This was built orginally as a chat application to talk about College Football live during the games.
* It allows you to post Images as well as messages
* Since this was built for college football, each user can be a 'Staff' or not, which the end user can choose to only view staff posts or view all posts. That way it could function as live coverage / recaps from staff members of the blog
* This is far from ready for prod - but a good starting point and it kept me entertained. I plan to come back to this and hopefully finish before the college football season is over.
